Since Online Learning will go through for this whole year, I need to change my perspective towards Online Learning in order for me to continue being one of Dean's List in UiTM Machang. </p>

	<p> I decided to motiavte myself by finding best quotes on Google to boost up my spirit towards Online Learning. So there are a few quotes that I found on Google :- </p>
